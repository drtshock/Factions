# First Steps

## Faction Introduction

__Note: This guide assumes a server with a fairly stock configuration.__

Time to make your very own faction! Using `/f create <name>`, you can create a faction with whatever name you choose. I chose `/f create koolkids`.

Now let's improve your faction's public image. With the `/f desc <description>` command, we can set a description that players will see when they enter our faction's territory, or when they look it up with `/f show <faction>`. I did `/f create Where all the kool kids hang out ;^)`.

Don't forget to back up these claims with, well, a claim! Build an attractive house, and claim it with `/f claim`. This will only claim the chunk you're standing in, so if your house is bigger than that, you may have to run the command several times.

If you go out exploring, you're gonna wanna get back to your house. Lucky for you, a faction can have a home! Set this home with `/f sethome`, and go back to it with `/f home`.

Next is arguably the most important part of a faction - members! You can invite anyone you'd like on the server using `/f invite <player`. Let's try inviting... uh.... hmm... Notch, with `/f invite Notch`. On the off chance he decides to play, he can accept the invite with `/f join <your_factions_name>`.

Alright. This covers the basics of Factions. Of course, there's many more features to learn, but this should give you a great starting point for your next faction's adventure!
